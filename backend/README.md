SoluGrow Engine – Backend

This is the backend system of SoluGrow Engine,
a rule-based Gym SaaS built for business control,
loss recovery, and automation.

What this backend does:
- Enforces strict role-based access (SaaS Owner, Gym Owner, Trainer, Member)
- Automatically triggers Recovery Mode when income goes below break-even
- Locks pricing, discounts, and expenses in Recovery Mode
- Calculates Trainer TRS based on real results
- Holds trainer salary if result proof is missing
- Converts all currency to INR (AED, GBP)
- Sends system alerts via Telegram and WhatsApp

This backend is not controlled by humans.
Humans can view.
Rules decide.
